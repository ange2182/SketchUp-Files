# SketchUp-Files

This folder contains the models I've made in SketchUp. 

For each model, there will be a folder that contains a .stl file of the model along with png files of the model from different angles.

The .stl files allow you to move around the model and to zoom in and out and to see the wire frame of the model.  
The png files are there to show how the model looks within SketchUp.
