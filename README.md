# SketchUp-Files

This folder will contain the models I've made in SketchUp. For each model or scene, it will have a folder that contains multiple images from different angles of the 3D model or scene.

Have a tutorial folder (the house and cube) where I add the images, but also state, hey this was made by following along to an online tutorial.
